# nixy

Author: Brian Tomlinson <darthlukan@gmail.com>


## Description

Nixy is yet another IRC bot. At least it will be once I get to writing it.


## TODO

It should:
1. Connect to an IRC server
2. Join a channel
3. Have a name
4. Read the channel and respond to URLs by shortening them and displaying them in the channel
5. Search the internet based on a user queries and return results
6. Allow users to set quotes
7. Allow users to retrieve quotes (database)
8. Allow users to leave notes for other users, these notes should display when the intended user is active in the
   channel again
9. Have a plugin system
10. Be able to load plugins while running (via command or plugin directory write detection)
